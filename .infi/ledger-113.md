# Ledger — #113 (S4a): LarkIdentityProvider driver

Dev 3. Branch `approof/113-s4a`. Tier auth. Recon `docs/superpowers/recon/s4-lark-org-sync.md` §7.

Record shape and re-pointing are frozen pending the user's answer to Q4 (LDAP/Lark
conflict scope). Everything here is deliberately the part that does not depend on it.

## Slice 1 — the unique index (RF-3)

Ruling: a PLAIN unique on `(orgId, source, externalId)`. My own contract had said
local groups (all NULL `externalId`) would collide under one, and that a partial or
`NULLS NOT DISTINCT` form was needed. Measured on PostgreSQL 17.11 instead of reasoned
about: Postgres treats NULLs as distinct, so they do not collide. Corrected on the
issue before anyone built on it. If wrong: the migration would carry a complication
that does nothing, and the "fix" for it corrupts real deployments.

Ruling (TL-1 RF-3): the local rows are seeded BEFORE this migration runs, not after.
Seeding after `migrate deploy` tests the constraint's behaviour but never the
migration's — and the migration is the half that executes against a populated
production database. `migrate deploy` has no "up to" flag, so the boundary is drawn by
parking the migration directory and restoring it in a `finally`.

The payoff is measurable: with the rows seeded afterwards, the `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`
mutant killed ONE test. Seeded before, it kills the entire suite in `beforeAll`:

```
ERROR: could not create unique index "groups_orgId_source_externalId_key"
DETAIL: Key ("orgId", source, "externalId")=(1, local, null) is duplicated.
```

Ruling (TL-1): the neighbouring index is the wrong model, and the migration says so in
a comment. `principal_role_grants` (`20260902020000:158`) DOES use `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`
deliberately — there a NULL `workspace_id` MEANS "org-wide", so two such rows are the
same grant and a plain unique let them duplicate on re-runs. Here a NULL `externalId`
means "no external identity", and two groups without one are two different groups.
Same syntax, inverted meaning. If wrong: the closest example in the tree is exactly the
thing not to copy, and nothing would have said so.

### Evidence, slice 1

- RED without the migration: only the duplicate-department test fails. The three "must
  still be allowed" cases pass, which is what makes the RED meaningful rather than a
  suite that is simply broken.
- 5/5 green with it.
- Three mutants, each killed by its named test:
  - `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` → the whole suite, at `migrate deploy`
  - drop `source` from the key → the cross-source test
  - drop `orgId` from the key → the cross-org test
- Two of those tests are not on the RF list. They exist because both columns are
  load-bearing and nothing else proved it: an LDAP group and a Lark department may
  legitimately carry the same opaque id, and one tenant's department id must not
  collide with another's.

## Residual risks

1. **The migration-parking harness mutates the working tree during a test run.**
   `groupsExternalIdUnique.test.js` renames `prisma/migrations/20260902120000_*` aside
   to draw a "migrate up to here" boundary, then restores it. The restore is in a
   `finally`, and it was verified to hold on the run where the `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`
   mutant killed `beforeAll` mid-flight — no stranded directory, no orphaned
   `s4a_idx_*` database. But a `SIGKILL` between the two renames leaves the repository
   without that migration, and the failure would look like a missing file rather than
   an interrupted test. Nothing else in the suite does this; it is here because there
   is no other way to place data between two migrations with `migrate deploy`.
2. **Q4 is unanswered**, so the driver's record shape is not frozen. Recon §7.4 covers
   both answers; (b) "Lark re-points every conflicting link" carries a shape
   structurally identical to the account takeover R1 exists to prevent, and TL-1 notes
   that no delta API makes it worse — every full sync becomes another opportunity to
   re-point.
